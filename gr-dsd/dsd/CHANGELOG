1.7.0-dev
    New features:
    CMake build system replaces Makefile
    Use libsndfile for reading and writing audio files
    Initial DSTAR voice support

1.6.0
   New features:
   Auto mutes P25 encrypted signals by default.
   Raised cosine filters.

   Fixed bugs:
   Changed the crazy dibit buffer which filled for ever until it
   ran out of allocated memory then caused a segmentation error. The
   buffer is now allowed to fill to 90% before being returned to the
   initial pointer value where it over writes the old samples, it
   seems to work ok and no segmentation errors now.
   Input level is now calculated differently, before when it reported 50%
   the soundcard would be fully overloaded. With the new method aim for 30% inlvl.

1.4.1
	New features:
    Several new sync types for existing formats now recognized:
      Decodes voice from NXDN 4800 (6.25kHz) signals
  	  Decodes voice from NXDN 9600 (12.5kHz) repeater output
	  Decodes voice from DMR/MotoTRBO simplex/repeater input
	  Decodes voice from X2-TDMA simplex/repeater input

	Fixed bugs:
	renamed "input:" to "inlvl:" to reduce confusion.  This value
	indicates the audio input level, NOT the "decode success
	rate".  Voice decode errors are indicated by the errorbars "=".

1.4
	New features:
	Decodes voice from NXDN 9600 (12.5 kHz) simplex/repeater input
	NXDN96 frames enabled by default
	Improved resistance to NXDN96 sync false positives

	Fixed bugs:
	.wav file header updated after playing .imb/.amb data files
	.imb/.amb files now have correct tgid in filename

1.3.1	New features:
        Support for ProVoice EA sync
	CTRL-C is now caught so .wav files can be properly closed
	DSD now shows mbelib version as well as it's own version
	-R resume option now triggers on any TSDU so control channels can be left
	in conventional scanlists.
	Auto output gain now has 0.5 second hold time for faster error burst recovery
	(was 1.5 seconds)
        Audio output upsampling function simplified and improved

	Fixed bugs:
	DSD_Author.pgp now has correct public key (was copy of mbelib_Author key)
	TGID and SRC are now cleared after TDULC or TDU.
	Voice error counter is now reset in noCarrier()
	TGID and SRC were not displaying for X2-TDMA frames
	Fixed buffer issue in resumeScan()
	Fixed error in .wav file headers preventing playback on some apps

1.3	New features:
        Decodes voice from ProVoice signals (requires -fp option)
	algid and kid are now shown in hex notation

	Fixed bugs:
	auto output gain now has faster rise time
	MoTDMA is now correctly labeled X2-TDMA

1.2	New features:
        Decodes voice for DMR standard (including MOTOTRBO)
        Full metadata (src, talkgroup, lcinfo, mfid, lcformat, mi, algid, keyid) for X2-TDMA
        TDMA slot identification for X2-TDMA/DMR/MOTOTRBO
        Identifies non-voice frame types for X2-TDMA/DMR/MOTOTRBO
        Frame only (no voice yet) support for 9600 baud NXDN
	Auto leveling audio output gain (default) and -g option for fixed gain
	GFSK modulation optimizations and improved C4FM/GFSK/QPSK auto detect

	Fixed bugs:
	nac was showing wrong ID
	P25 metadata (lcinfo, mfid, lfcormat, mi, keyid, algid, lsd) are now
	  printed out in the correct bit order (MSB -> LSB), was reversed.
	fixed serveral bugs in dsd_upsample.c, with improved quality

1.1	New features:
	Scanner control options to allow scan resume during certain TDULC
        Improved upsampling function audio quality
        Greatly improved handling of X2-TDMA frames
	Much faster QPSK decision point tracking by default

	Fixed bugs:
	playMbeFiles was not output to .wav file when -w was given
    	Now correctly detects/handles Mot and P25 talkgroup formats
	PDU frames were not detected

1.0.3	Fixed buggy C4FM/QPSK auto detection and added -A option to adjust it.

1.0 Initial release
