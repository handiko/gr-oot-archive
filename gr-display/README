gr-display is a small qt based addon for gnuradio.

It contains two components:
show_image   - to display png images.
show_text    - to display ascii characters as text in a qt window.

I use show_image to receive and display some weather- satellite pictures with the funcube dongle
and gnuradio.

Both blocks are using the new post 3.7- api.
You'll find them in
Instrumentation - Qt in grc.


1. Dependencies:

- gnuradio (3.7)
- gr-qtgui
- qt4 ( tested with qt4.8 )


2. Installation

get the latest code from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-display

The build process is cmake based. So change to the code directory.
There
$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where gnuradio is installed> ../
$make
$su
$make install

++++ If you are unsure about <where gnuradio is installed> run

gnuradio-config-info --prefix


After that you'll find in grc in Instrumentation / Qt a PNG Image sink and a Text sink.


3. To do

- Perhaps do some simple image processing like rotating before saving.


4. Using the example 

The example shows the usage of the show_image block and requires the gr-fcdproplus block.
You have to run the decodeapt block and install it in your grc, first.
You'll find this afterwards in the 'custom' section.

An example for the usage of the show_text block can be found in the gr-ax25 block.

5. Credits

The apt decoder part is based on an decoder prototype by  Alexandru Csete, OZ9AEC.
