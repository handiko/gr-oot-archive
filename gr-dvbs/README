The goal of this project is to build a software-defined DVB-S
transmitter, based on the EN 300 421 V1.1.2 Framing structure,
channel coding and modulation for 11/12 GHz satellite services
standard:

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/300400_300499/300421/01.01.02_60/en_300421v010102p.pdf

The randomizer, Reed Solomon, and puncturing blocks are from
gr-dvb (https://github.com/EdmundTse/gr-dvb) and converted to
GnuRadio 3.7.x. The interleaver block is from gr-qam
(https://github.com/argilo/gr-qam).

A gnuradio-companion flowgraph (dvbs_tx.grc) for the bladeRF
transmit capable SDR is included along with a stand-alone
Python script for bladeRF (dvbs-blade-py).

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Contributions are welcome!

Update (6/18/2014):

A new DVB-S modulator block has been added that implements
zero-stuffing 2X interpolation. This allows the use of an
FFT-based root-raised-cosine filter instead of the more
computationally intense interpolating FIR filter.
